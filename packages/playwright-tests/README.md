This directory contains AI-generated Playwright test files created by the QAAI platform.

## ⚠️ Important

- **Do not manually edit** test files in this directory
- Test files are automatically generated by the Generator worker
- Files are gitignored to prevent committing generated code
- Tests are executed by the Runner service in isolated environments

## Structure

```
{project-id}-{suite-id}-{test-case-id}.spec.js
```

## Execution

Tests are executed by the Runner service using the Playwright configuration located at:

```

## Results

Test results, artifacts, and reports are stored in:
- `results/` - JUnit XML, HTML reports
- Supabase Storage - Traces, videos, screenshots
